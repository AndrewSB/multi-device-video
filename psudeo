create server that can choose video and getDimensions() (that means it needs a window in the DOM)

create 'clients' that dont choose videos but just create a connection to a server; the server would then send a signal saying 'start' and the getDimensions would optimize a rectangle from the chosen video JSON

Then, it'll show a little window with a layout guide

Then once every user hits the button, saying 'start', it'll play
